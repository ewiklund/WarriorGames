WarriorGames is a simple program that takes the match scores between 2 NBA teams; Golden State Warriors and 
Houston Rockets.
The results are hardcoded and when you run it from VSC; you will see 2 labels; one for each team with the results in red/green.
The red is for a loss and the green is for a win.
